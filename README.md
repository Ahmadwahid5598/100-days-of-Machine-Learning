# 100-days-of-Machine-Learning
I will try my best to explain ML concepts and programming from basics to advanced level.

## **Roadmap**
#### **Part 1 **

*   What is Machine Learning? What problems does it try to solve? What are themain categories and fundamental concepts of Machine Learning systems?
*   The main steps in a typical ML project.
*   Learning by fitting a model data.
*   Optimizing a cost function.
*   Handling, cleaning, and preparing data.
*   Selecting and engineering features.
*   Selecting a model and tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation.
*   The main challenges of ML, in particular underfitting and overfitting( the bais/variance tradeoff).
*   Reducing the dimensionality of the training data to fight the curse of dimensionality.
*   Other unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, density estimation and anomaly detection.
*   The most common learning algorithms: Linear and Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Ensembles methods.
